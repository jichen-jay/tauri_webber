I've really struggled to get any VPN to work on NixOS stable 24.11.

]()

[I first tried with PIA but couldn't get a functioning connection. I then tried protonVPN as the documentation was clearer around wireguard. I followed the wireguard advie here]() [https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/WireGuard]() but still couldn't get it to work declaratively. However I did manage to get a functioning connection using this command from the cli: /etc/nixos/wireguard/wg0.conf . Which activates the wireguard config file generated by protonVPN and produces a connection that works.

I've tried to add it to my config file using as per the tutorial:

networking.wg-quick.interfaces.wg0.configFile = "/etc/nixos/files/wireguard/wg0.conf";

But despite running the same program and connecting, the connection it creates does not allow internet traffic.

I am a little stumped. Any advice about what I'm missing? I've been through numerous tutorials for wireguard and openVPN and I can't see where I'm going wrong.

[Intel should release a 24GB version of the Arc B580]()

[]()

[]()

[

The B580 is already showing impressive performance for LLM inference, matching the RTX 3060 in Vulkan benchmarks (~36 tokens/sec on Qwen2 7B) while being more power efficient and $50 cheaper. But VRAM is the real bottleneck for running larger models locally.

With Intel's strong XMX matrix performance and the existing clamshell memory design validated in shipping docs, a 24GB variant is technically feasible. This would enable running 13B models quantized to 8-bit (most 13B models need ~14GB), existing models with larger context, etc.

It would have way better price/performance than RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, native Vulkan support without CUDA lock-in and more performance potential if OpenVINO is further optimized.

The regular B580's stellar price/performance ratio shows Intel can be aggressive on pricing. A ~$329 24GB variant would hit a sweet spot for local LLM enthusiasts building inference rigs.

This is Intel's chance to build mind- and marketshare among AI developers and enthusiasts who are tired of CUDA lock-in. They can grow a community around OpenVINO and their AI tooling. Every developer who builds with Intel's stack today helps their ecosystem forward. The MLPerf results show they have the performance - now they just need to get the hardware into developers' hands.

## Comparing Flakes to Traditional Nix

### Flakes

{
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {
    myHello = (import nixpkgs {}).hello;
  };
}

Build it and generate a `flake.nix`.

-   Version control is required.
    
-   In flakes there is no access to `builtins.currentSystem` so you have to implicitly add it. Commands like this and `builtins.getEnv "USER` are impure because they depend on the current system which can be different from user to user.
    
-   Flakes enable pure evaluation mode by default, so with our flake as is running: `nix build .#myHello`
    

will fail. To get around this you can pass:

 nix build .#myHello --impure

or add the system attribute with your current system, `flake-utils` simplifies making flakes system agnostic:

{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in {
        packages.myHello = pkgs.hello;
      }
    );
}

This will allow it to successfully build with `nix build .#myHello`

### Traditional Nix

Create a `default.nix` with the following contents:

{ myHello = (import <nixpkgs> { }).hello; }

Build it with:

nix-build -A myHello

We can see that it's impure with the nix repl:

nix repl
nix-repl> <nixpkgs>
/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixos

-   The output is the path to the nixpkgs channel and impure because it can be different between users, it depends on the environment
    

To make the `default.nix` pure we can add this:

let
  nixpkgs = fetchTarball {
    url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/<rev>";
  };
in {
  myHello = (import <nixpkgs> {}).hello;
}

-   github provides archives of specific commits.
    
-   We can get the revision number from the `flake.lock` file.
    

cat flake.lock
# ...
"rev": "0243fb86a6f43e506b24b4c0533bd0b0de211c19"
# ...

let
  nixpkgs = fetchTarball {
    url =
      "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0243fb86a6f43e506b24b4c0533bd0b0de211c19.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
  };
in { myHello = (import nixpkgs { }).hello; }

-   You enter a placeholder for the sha256 with 52 zeros, after you run: `nix-build -A myHello` Nix will give you the correct hash to replace the zeros.
    

You can see that they produce the same result by running:

`ls -al` in the flake directory and comparing the result symlink to the `nix-build -A myHello` results.

‚ùØ nix-build -A myHello
/nix/store/a7hnr9dcmx3qkkn8a20g7md1wya5zc9l-hello-2.12.1
‚ùØ ls -al
drwxr-xr-x    - jr 17 Jan 14:44 Óóª .git
lrwxrwxrwx    - jr 17 Jan 15:01 Óóø result -> /nix/store/a7hnr9dcmx3qkkn8a20g7md1wya5zc9l-hello-2.12.1

-   In `default.nix` there is still an impurity, the system and actually more.
    
-   Nixpkgs has 3 main arguments that people care about:
    
    -   overlays, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays
        
    -   config, by default ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix
        
    -   system, by default builtins.currentSystem
        

And they all have defaults that are impure.

Users have problems because they don't realize that defaults are pulled in and they have some overlays and config.nix that are custom to their setup. This can't happen in flakes because they enforces this. We can override this by passing empty lists and attribute sets and a system argument to the top-level function with a default like so:

{system ? builtins.currentSystem}:
let
  nixpkgs = fetchTarball {
    url =
      "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0243fb86a6f43e506b24b4c0533bd0b0de211c19.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "1qvdbvdza7hsqhra0yg7xs252pr1q70nyrsdj6570qv66vq0fjnh";
  };
in { myHello = (import nixpkgs {
    overlays = \[\];
    config = {};
    inherit system;
  }).hello;
}

-   We want to be able to change the system even if we're on a different one, what typically is done is having a system argument to the top-level function like above.
    
-   The main expression is pure now but the top-level function is still impure, but we can override it with the following:
    

if you import this file from somewhere else:

`import ./default.nix { system = "x86_64-linux"; }`

or from the cli:

nix-build -A myHello --argstr system x86\_64-linux

or if you already have the path in your store you can try to build it with:

nix-build -A myHello --argstr system x86\_64-linux --check

-   It's called `--check` because it builds it again and then checks if the results are in the same path.
    
-   You can also use pure evaluation mode in the old nix commands:
    

Get the rev from `git log`:

nix-instantiate --eval --pure-eval --expr 'fetchGit { url = ./.; rev = "1d2d01edd53154d581d89518d4aaf59c4597fdff"; }'

**Output**:

{ lastModified = 1737153709; lastModifiedDate = "20250117224149"; narHash = "sha256-z2dbpuLObb9WMZE6XR8TFi8L66FoxRTtLsO16jfRpyY="; outPath = "/nix/store/pgkcrzj0qfrc237lm0v7l4rhj0yv64bs-source"; rev = "1d2d01edd53154d581d89518d4aaf59c4597fdff"; revCount = 4; shortRev = "1d2d01e"; submodules = false; }

-   The `outPath` is how you evaluate derivations to path:
    

nix repl
nix-repl> :l <nixpkgs>
nix-repl> hello.outPath
"/nix/store/a7hnr9dcmx3qkkn8a20g7md1wya5zc9l-hello-2.12.1"
nix-repl> "${hello}"
"/nix/store/a7hnr9dcmx3qkkn8a20g7md1wya5zc9l-hello-2.12.1"
nix-repl> attrs = { outPath = "foo"; }
nix-repl> "${attrs}"
"foo"

-   This shows how derivations get interpolated into strings.
    
-   Now we can build the actual derivation with this:
    

 nix-build --pure-eval --expr '(import (fetchGit { url = ./.; rev = "1d2d01edd53154d581d89518d4aaf59c4597fdff"; }) { system = "x86\_64-linux"; }).myHello'

-   As you can see this is very inconvenient, also every time you make a change you have to commit it again to get a new revision we also need to interpolate the string to get the revision into the string.
    
-   Flakes are obviously way easier to evaluate in pure mode as they do it by default.
    

### Back to Flakes

If we want to build the flake with a different Nixpkgs:

nix build .#myHello --override-input nixpkgs github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.11
result/bin/hello --version

We can't really do this with our `default.nix` because it's hard-coded within a let statement.

A common way around this is to write another argument which is `nixpkgs`:

{ system ? builtins.currentSystem,
  nixpkgs ? fetchTarball {
    url =
      "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0243fb86a6f43e506b24b4c0533bd0b0de211c19.tar.gz";
    sha256 = "1qvdbvdza7hsqhra0yg7xs252pr1q70nyrsdj6570qv66vq0fjnh";
  },
  pkgs ? import nixpkgs {
    overlays = \[ \];
    config = { };
    inherit system;
},
}: {
  myHello = pkgs.hello;
}

Build it:

nix-build -A myHello

or

nix-build -A myHello --arg nixpkgs 'fetchTarball { url =
"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0243fb86a6f43e506b24b4c0533bd0b0de211c19.tar.gz"; }'\`

-   `arg` provides a nix value as an argument, `argstr` turns a given string into a nix argument. Here we're not using pure evaluation mode for a temp override.
    

or another impure command that you can add purity aspects to, Traditional Nix has a lot of impurities by default but in almost all cases you can make it pure:

nix-build -A myHello --arg channel nixos-24.11

### Update the Nixpkgs version in flakes

nix build .#myHello

Doing this with Traditional Nix is pretty easy with `niv`:

nix-shell -p niv
niv init

-   This creates a `nix/` directory with a `sources.json` (lockfile) & `sources.nix` (big file managed by `niv` to do the import correctly).
    

In our `default.nix`:

{ system ? builtins.currentSystem,
sources ? import nix/sources.nix,
nixpkgs ? sources.nixpkgs,
pkgs ? import nixpkgs {
  overlays = \[ \];
  config = { };
  inherit system;
}, }: {
  myHello = pkgs.hello;
}

Build it:

nix-build -A myHello

`niv` can do much more, you can add a dependency with github owner and repo:

niv add TSawyer87/system
niv drop system

-   use `niv drop` to remove dependencies.
    
-   Update nixpkgs:
    

niv update nixpkgs --branch=nixos-unstable
nix-build -A myHello

The flake and default.nix are both using the same store object:

‚ùØ nix-build -A myHello

-   `niv` only relies on stable NixOS features, can be used for automatic source updates. They do the source tracking recursively,
    

### Adding Home-Manager

**Flakes:**

{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, ... }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in { packages.myHello = pkgs.hello; });
}

nix flake update
nix flake show github:nix-community/home-manager

-   Flakes have a standard structure that Traditional Nix never had, the flake provides a default package, nixosModules, packages for different architectures, and templates. Pretty convenient.
    
-   If you look at your `flake.lock` you'll see that home-manager was added as well as another `nixpkgs`.
    

**Traditional Nix:**

niv add nix-community/home-manager

nix repl
nix-repl> s = import ./nix/sources.nix
nix-repl> s.home-manager

We can follow the outPath and see that there's a `default.nix`, `flake.nix`, `flake.lock` and much more. In the `default.nix` you'll see a section for `docs`.

-   Home-manager has a `.outPath` that it uses by default which is a function, and Nix uses the `default.nix` by default.
    

If we want to build the docs go back to our `default.nix`:

{ system ? builtins.currentSystem, sources ? import nix/sources.nix
, nixpkgs ? sources.nixpkgs, pkgs ? import nixpkgs {
  overlays = \[ \];
  config = { };
  inherit system;
}, }: {
  homeManagerDocs = (import sources.home-manager { pkgs = pkgs; }).docs;

  myHello = pkgs.hello;
}

Build it:

nix-build -A homeManagerDocs

With the `flake.nix` to do this you would add:

{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, home-manager, ... }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in {
        packages.myHello = pkgs.hello;
        packages.x86\_64-linux.homeManagerDocs =
          home-manager.packages.x86\_64-linux.docs-html;
      });
}

Build it:

nix build .#myHello

-   To have home-manager use the same Nixpkgs as your flake inputs you can add this under the home-manager input:
    

`home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";`

-   I added a few more things to this, I'm not trying to do a full-blown comparison of everything that post would be way longer than this is already. Thanks for reading
